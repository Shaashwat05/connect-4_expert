# connect-4_expert
This project is based on Connect-4, a famous board game. It uses **Pygame** to make the graphics of the game and **minimax algorithm** to make the AI. One can play either individually with the AI, or a 2 player game with another user. And finally it uses **socket-programming** to make the AI a server so that any client can access and play the game easily.

## Getting Started

Download a python interpeter preferable a version beyond 3.0. Install the prerequisute libraries given below. Run 
**2_player.py** -  to play a 2 player game with another user

**minimax_game2.py** - to play with the AI

**Client** and **server** file if u want to test socket programming
